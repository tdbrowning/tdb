<h2>Additive combinatorics</h2>

<h4>October - November 2025</h4>


Tim Browning and Matthew Kwan


<hr>


<h5>Synopsis</h5>

  <p>
  Additive combinatorics is the study of additive questions about finite sets of integers. 
  Possible topics include the theorems of Roth and Szemer√©di (on additive progressions in dense sets of integers), Freiman's theorem and its relatives (on the structure of sumsets that are almost closed under addition), sum-product phenomena, applications to exponential sum estimates of Bourgain et al over multiplicative subgroups of finite fields, and to the Littlewood-Offord problem. A particular aim of the course will be to give a taster of the varied methods which have been brought to bear on the subject: Fourier analysis, polynomial methods, probabilistic methods, methods from information theory, graph theory and incidence geometry.
  
  
  This course will have two parts:
  <ul>
  
  <li>Part I (Browning) will focus more on the <i>number theory</i></li>
  
  
  <li>Part II (Kwan) will focus more on the <i>combinatorics</i>
</li>
 
  </ul>
  
</p>


<h5>Timetable</h5>

All talks are at 10:15-11:30 and take place in Mondi 4:
